# Matrix-Factorization-for-Recommender-System-on-Music-Data-using-Stochastic-Gradient-Descent

This project analyzes the use of matrix factorization and stochastic gradient descent in building a recommender system for music data. It describes the use of stochastic gradient descent for finding the optimal values of P and Q vectors and introduces a regularization term λ to avoid over-fitting. An experiment with default hyperparameters and three experiments with different tweaked parameters is conducted, including λ, k, α, and epochs. The results show the impact of these parameters on the performance of the model, highlighting the importance of choosing the right hyperparameters for building an accurate recommender system. The detailed report discusses the two types of recommender systems, namely content filtering and collaborative filtering, and highlights the use of matrix factorization for generating latent features to build the collaborative filtering system.
